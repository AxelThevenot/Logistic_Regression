Gradient descent method for logistic regression

```

```

## Let's start with python

### Import

Firstly we need to import csv to extract the data from a .csv file, numpy to deal with array or matrix and we need to import matplotib for the render.

```python

```

### Variables

As usual I made a region to change the variables to an easier understanding. Variables that can be manually changed are those, which are in uppercases. They are classed as variables for : 
* 
* 
* 
* Rendering the algorithm output

```python

```

### Load dataset



```python

```


### Logistic regression


```python

```

 

```python

```

```python

```

### Display



```python


```

Finally, implement the `key_pressed()` function to activate the algorithm when Enter key is pressed.

```python


```
### Run it ! 

```python

```
